Shapefiles consist of many files, some of which store the geographic information, some the coordinate system description, some the additional attributes of the geographical objects. [geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) is able to read shapefiles natively into its base class GeoDataFrame, which has a similar API to that of `pandas` `DataFrames`. This is convenient, because we can use all of our previous knowledge of `pandas`.*\n",

For this exercise, the spherical coordinate system of lon, lat values is not convenient, since we cannot calculate distances in meters as easily as we would in a Cartesian coordinate system.

A good choice for a Cartesian system is for example the Pseudo-Mercator projection ([epsg=3857](https://epsg.io/3857)). The `pyproj` library is especially lightweight to use in Python."
